As a result, they face many everyday forms of exclusion, including lack of access to medical services. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork, this article examines experiences of patients from newly acceded CEE countries. Cross-border health care highlights instrumentality because implementation has consisted only of patchwork policies and is characterised by insufficient attention to marginalised populations, such as those who are driven to seek work abroad due to economic asymmetries across borders. In the current transitional period, evidence suggests a disconnect as social rights struggle to catch up to economic ones.}ed_with_EU_Integration_on_Medical_Care.pdf},

Our critical faculties and means to test out established relations between global\textendash local, centre\textendash periphery, macro\textendash micro are crucial to see how far the EU's normative power and European integration as a governance model permeates peoples' and states' lives in Europe, broadly defined.

This is important to European Union studies generally because careful observation and analysis of everyday engagements can help to reveal the basis upon which the EU gains legitimacy, or, alternatively, the grounds for resistance to further integration. Through an examination of Poles' experiences of mobility, and their reflections about crossing national borders to work and travel, the paper shows that instrumentality is not just motivated by economic interests, but also by the desire to advance culturally, socially and symbolically within a global imaginary of hierarchically ranked nations. As such, support for European integration tends to weaken in situations where ongoing inequalities and exclusions lead to perceptions of social demotion. Further, instrumentalities can deepen meaningful engagement with the EU in ways that also reassert national loyalties.}

The concept of `Euroscepticism' is shown here as a useful linguistic and sociological starting point for examining the transformative power of the EU in the politics of all levels of European societies. The ways in which people express their support, opposition or ennui in regard to the role of `Europe' in their lives delineates here the instrumentalism in the way they approach advancing European integration. The processes of resisting, negotiating and adapting (and adapting to) European integration are offered here as topics of anthropological significance in their own right. A case study from one former socialist country, Bulgaria, illustrates what may be suggested as a commonplace sentiment throughout the EU \textendash{} a feeling of marginality due to the disconnection and disaffection that remain at the heart of Euroscepticism in all of its forms. Bulgaria offers a frame through which to reflect on the reformulations in local, regional and national political society as they relate to supranational and transnational forces throughout Europe, and to illustrate how an anthropological attention to the issues of post-socialism in Central and Eastern Europe may benefit from an examination of the new forces of European integration.}n_at_a_Margin_of_Europe.pdf},

By doing so, EU-Europe is really constructing with ``Euroland'' and ``Schengenland'' a ``European space''. But in a powerful process it is simultaneously creating ``European places'' and ``European localities'', whereby the ``European'' is becoming increasingly ``local'' and the ``local'' clearly ``europeanised'' at the same time. Using Brussels, Euralille and Vienna as examples, this essay will look into this process of the localisation of Europe and the Europeanisation of the local. In doing so, my ethnographical perspective is directed at cities, setting its sights on the various forms but also on the respective protagonists of Europeanisation, because the Europeanisation of the local and the localisation of the European are often contested and linked with the construction of a specific ``cultural heritage''.}

often linked to whiteness, secularism, legitimate class and gender performances.
We ask to look back across pasts and into the present in order to explore who currently marks the boundaries of what is considered civilised, cultured, ``normal'' and comes to define what is considered a european body. What embodies the present, which and whose body epitomises europeaness and how does europeanisation generate (tacit) knowledge about the legitimate body?}

These markings, distinctions and classifications are denoted on bodily hexis and body performance and evoke stereotypes and essentialised representations of national cultures. However, after the enlargements of the EU in 2004 and 2007 they also reveal a postcolonial and imperial dynamic that perpetuates the division into `old' and `new' Europe and enables people from old member states to emerge as a different class that holds its cultural power firm in a dense political environment permeated by networks.}

As a result, the ideology and politics of nationalism are far better understood than the creation of Hungarianness and Swedishness.
This paper1 discusses some approaches in the national culture-building of everyday life, using mainly Swedish examples. The focus is also on national culture as a battle arena, where different interest groups use arguments about national unity or heritage in hegemonic struggles.
Different types of ``nationalization processes'' are discussed, as for example ways in which cer- tain cultural domains come to be defined as national, how national space is transformed into cul- tural space, or the way in which every new generation not only is nationalized into a given heritage but also creates its own version of a common, national frame of reference.}

Arising in societies under threat, both ritual forms represent in their mediatized expression alternative public theologies centered around an ideal of a society at peace and possessing moral unity. It is this mediatization of these crisis rituals that gives them a meaning beyond itself, offering a moral and spiritual frame of reference for both European society as a whole and for its citizens individually.}Mediatization.pdf},

The EU has taken formal positions to promote access to comprehensive reproductive health services. In tension with the EU's position is the Vatican, which promotes the use of conscientious objection to decline the provision of certain health services. Currently, the use of conscientious objection is mostly unregulated, prompting debates about supranational regulation at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) meeting in Paris in 2010. This article uses the lens of the PACE meeting debate to consider the cultural, historical and political specificities and agendas that give shape to competing arguments about rights, health and state sovereignty. I argue that political rationalities directed towards reproduction locally and the supranational rights debates work synergistically to paralyse European reproductive health policymaking.}},

Drawing on Stuart Hall's theoretical distinction of different positions of `decoding', the article demonstrates how the `bottom-up frame' is interpreted and adapted strategically from a `dominant-hegemonic', `negotiated' and `oppositional' position.}},

  author = {R{\"o}mhild, Regina},
  year = {2010},

  pages = {23--44},
  abstract = {This article seeks to Europeanise and to ,,anthropologise`` the current debate on precariousness: a debate which is, predominantly, led under the premise of the (Western European) nation state, and its concepts of a national solidarity among national subjects with national rights to citizenship. By contrast, and by drawing on ethnographic research in Belgrade, the article argues towards a transcendent perspective focussing on the increasing interdependencies, and in that sense, the emerging ,,assemblages`` of local, national, transnational, and global economies, politics, and social practices within and beyond the shifting borders of the European Union. What tends to be overseen at the ,,centre`` becomes obvious at the ,,periphery`` of the New Europe: the fundamental precarisation of the relationship between citizen and state, due to multiple pressures on the nation state: from being exposed to political Europeanisation and neoliberal economic globalization to being globalized ,,from below`` by way of transnational migration. In Belgrade, i. e. in one of the new nation states of the post-socialist, post-war fringes of the shifting EU borders, the social erosion of the nation state and the resulting precariousness is not a marginal feature but the central common ground of social practice among all subjects involved, be they ,,proper`` citizens with a national passport, internally displaced persons of the former Yugoslavian state, or migrants with an ,,illegal`` status. In this comparatively advanced context of a fluid, dispersed state power, citizenship is no longer granted an exclusive privilege but subject to creative and collaborative forms of social self-organisation, including migration as a major tactic of realizing a transnational, ,,flexible citizenship`` across the borders of increasing European and global inequalities. Rather than being restricted to the ,,periphery``, this ethnographic view from the margins may well contribute to a broader understanding of social precariousness: as a general symptom of the current transformation of nationhood and statehood.}

German and Polish border guards develop informal strategies of action and communication that rest upon a joint professional culture, leading to mutual trust and solidarity and a congruence of subjective professional honor and official mandate. Yet, this win\textendash win situation runs the risk of emphasizing police-cultural aspects that focus on security while leaving the underlying East\textendash West asymmetry untouched.}

The authors brilliantly capture the mood of uncertainty and anxiety facing Europeans in a period of unprecedented uncertainty, insecurity and austerity. What they also show is how Europe's poor and marginalised are both shaped by and, in turn, try to shape or subvert the national and European policy regimes to which they are subjected.}

  abstract = {Halloumi/hellim is a cheese that does not belong to any one ethnic group or nation alone. Rather, its messy genealogy mirrors the complicated histories of the peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean. Historically, the multi ethnic and multi-religious population of Cyprus had many food traditions in common, and Peter Loizos in his work repeatedly referred to the importance of commensality and the shared culinary practices of Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Recently, however, Greek Cypriots are laying claim to halloumi cheese as an ethnicised national product. Since the EU accession of 2004, the Republic of Cyprus has become eligible to apply to the European Commission's programme for protective food labels to be awarded to so-called origin products. When a food item is declared an origin product, it is taken to represent the group`s history and its distribution is mapped onto the group's territory. The conflicts that ensued with the Republic of Cyprus' halloumi application to the EU are evidence of this type of `gastronationalism' (DeSoucey, 2010), but also show how the claim to exclusive cultural property is contested by local actors under conditions of globalising markets and supranational political regulation.}
